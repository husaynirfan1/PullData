Okay, so the user is asking how to use folder scope with Morphik. Let me check the context provided.

Looking through the document, there's a section about folders. The user mentioned "folder scope," which I think refers to organizing documents into folders. The context lists various API endpoints related to folders, like creating folders, listing folders, adding documents to folders, etc. 

The question is about using folder scope, which probably means managing documents within specific folders. From the document, the [List Folders](https://morphik.ai/docs/api-reference/folders/list-folders.md) endpoint returns all folders the user has access to. Similarly, [Get Folder](https://morphik.ai/docs/api-reference/folders/get-folder.md) retrieves a folder by name or UUID. 

So, the steps would involve identifying the folders, adding documents to them, and managing those folders. For example, using the [Add Document To Folder](https://morphik.ai/docs/api-reference/folders/add-document-to-folder.md) endpoint to add documents to a specific folder. Also, the [Create Folder](https://morphik.ai/docs/api-reference/folders/create-folder.md) allows creating new folders. 

The user might need to know how to structure their data by organizing documents into logical folders. They might also want to understand how to retrieve and manage these folders using the API endpoints mentioned. The answer should outline the process of listing folders, adding documents to them, and managing those folders, referencing the relevant API calls.

To use folder scope with Morphik, follow these steps based on the provided context:

1. **List Folders**: Use the `list-folders` endpoint to access all folders the user has access to. This provides a list of available folders for organizing documents.

2. **Identify Target Folder**: Determine the specific folder (by name or UUID) where you want to add documents. For example, use `get-folder` to retrieve details about a folder.

3. **Add Documents to Folders**: Add documents to a folder using the `add-document-to-folder` endpoint. Specify the folder ID or name to target the correct folder.

4. **Create New Folders**: If a folder does not exist, create it with the `create-folder` endpoint. Provide a unique identifier (e.g., folder name) to define the new folder.

5. **Manage Documents in Folders**: Use endpoints like `remove-document-from-folder` to delete documents from folders or `get-folder` to retrieve folder metadata.

6. **Organize Data**: Structure your data by logically grouping documents into folders, enabling efficient retrieval and management via API calls.

**Key Endpoints**:
- `list-folders`: Retrieve all accessible folders.
- `get-folder`: Get a folder by name/UUID.
- `add-document-to-folder`: Add a document to a specific folder.
- `create-folder`: Create a new folder for organizing documents.

This approach allows you to organize data hierarchically, leveraging Morphik's folder-based structure for scalable and manageable storage.
