- [Sources](#sources)

The status analysis in the Diagnostic Viewer refers to the process of evaluating the current state of the simulator and its components. It involves examining the system's nodes, which are organized in a hierarchy, to determine their statuses. The Viewer provides three types of information:

1. **Current State**: This indicates the current status of each node, which can be one of ten possible states (Ok, Warning, Error, Loading, Unloading, Unloaded, Not Computed, Not Responding, Disabled, and Info). The status is determined based on whether the component is powered up, booted, detected, or responding, as well as any errors or warnings.

2. **Past Events**: This section displays a history of past events related to each node. It allows users to understand if a particular node had failed in the past and who corrected it. The information can help identify patterns or recurring issues.

3. **Static Articles**: These are pre-defined articles (like STEP1) that provide useful information when a module malfunctions. They help users diagnose and fix issues by offering relevant data.

In summary, status analysis in the Diagnostic Viewer is crucial for understanding the current state of the simulator, identifying potential faults, and tracking historical events to improve system stability and debugging efficiency.
