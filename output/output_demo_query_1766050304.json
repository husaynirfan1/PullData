  "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the main concepts in machine learning, but the provided context is about hydraulic systems in an aircraft simulator. The document talks about hydraulic components, fault logs, and validation tolerances. There's no mention of machine learning or any related topics here.\n\nSo, the answer should state that the information isn't in the context. I need to make sure not to guess or infer anything beyond what's in the given text. The user might have thought there was a connection, but based on the provided document, there's no relevant info on machine learning.\n</think>\n\nI don't have enough information to answer this question. The provided context discusses hydraulic systems in an aircraft simulator, including fault logs, validation tolerances, and troubleshooting guides, but does not mention any concepts related to machine learning.",

      "text": "# B737-800 HYDRAULIC POWER SYSTEM (SIMULATION DATA)\n\n## 1.0 General System Description\nThe aircraft uses three independent hydraulic systems: System A, System B, and the Standby System.The nominal operating pressure for all main systems is 3000 psig.### 1.1 System A Components\nSystem A is powered by:\n1.**Engine-Driven Pump (EDP):** Located on the No.1 Engine accessory drive.2.**Electric Motor-Driven Pump (EMDP):** Powered by the AC Transfer Bus 2.In the simulator, the fluid dynamics are calculated by the `hyd_model_a.cpp` module.The reservoir quantity is represented by the variable `sim_hyd_sys_a_qty`.If this variable drops below 20%, the `LOW QTY` light on the overhead panel will illuminate.### 1.2 System B Components\nSystem B is powered by one EDP on the No.2 Engine and one EMDP powered by AC Transfer Bus 1.Note that the cooling lines for System B run through the fuel tank, meaning hydraulic overheating can occur if fuel quantity is low.## 2.0 SIMULATOR FAULT LOGIC (IOS)\n\nThe Instructor Operating Station (IOS) uses specific malfunction codes to trigger failures.The model uses a decay rate logic to simulate leaks.| Malfunction ID | Description | Simulation Effect | Trigger Variable |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **MALF_HYD_001** | Sys A EDP Failure | Pressure drops to 0 PSI in 3.5 seconds.| `ios_malf_hyd_edp_a_fail` |\n| **MALF_HYD_005** | Sys B Slow Leak | Quantity drops 2% per minute.| `ios_malf_hyd_leak_rate` |\n| **MALF_ELEC_PUMP** | EMDP Overheat | Pump case temp exceeds 115°C, tripping thermal breaker.| `ios_malf_emdp_ovht` |\n\n> **NOTE:** If `MALF_HYD_005` is active, the Standby System will NOT automatically activate unless the force flight control switch is toggled.## 3.0 QTG VALIDATION TOLERANCES (FAA PART 60)\n\nFor the simulator to be certified (Level D), the hydraulic control loading (feel system) must meet the following objective test criteria:\n\n### 3.1 Control Loading Static Friction\n* **Elevator:** Breakout force must be within ± 2.0 lbs of aircraft data."
