Machine Learning Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train algorithms. The algorithm learns patterns from the input data and corresponding output labels. Common applications include classification and regression tasks.

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical use cases.

3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable actions to maximize reward in a particular situation. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

Key Concepts:

- Training Data: The dataset used to train the model
- Features: Input variables used for making predictions
- Model: The mathematical representation learned from data
- Accuracy: Measure of how well the model performs

Applications:
Machine learning powers recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection systems.
